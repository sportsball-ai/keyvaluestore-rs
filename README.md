# keyvaluestore-rs

You can find rustdocs for the master branch of this repo at https://sportsball-ai.github.io/keyvaluestore-rs/keyvaluestore/

Like [ccbrown/keyvaluestore](https://github.com/ccbrown/keyvaluestore) but for Rust.

Abstracts a key-value store interface over AWS DynamoDB, Redis, and in-memory. Allows dynamic backend selection, and provides a read cache wrapper for these backends.
